	<p>HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets,
within the web page content. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs, although some tags 
represent empty elements and so are unpaired, such as the img tag. The first tag in a pair
is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and
closing tags). In between these tags web designers can add text, further tags, comments and
other types of text-based content.</p>

	<p>The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and compose them into visible or 
audible web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to 
interpret the content of the page.</p>
