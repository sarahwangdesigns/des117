		<p> This is a paragraph of text. <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is a structural block 
		level tag that has a break above it and below it automatically. I can just go on 
		and on but I better finish this exercise right now.</p>
		
		<p style="width:5in;">If I wanted to control the width of a paragraph so that it 
		doesn't go on and on and on and become difficult on the reader, I can use a local 
		style to set the width of the paragraph. In general, people like to read 7-9 words 
		per line. There are more rules to it than that, but I will leave that to what I 
		will learn later in the class for right now&mdash;I am just making a quick 
		reference. Remember html reads only one space and no reurns. Formatting text will 
		make more sense with <code>css</code>. <code>html5</code> is pretty darn limited! 
		Even if       I       type      in    a    bunch of spaces          here, they
		won't show       in the browser   window.</p>

	<p>How do you like me now? I can make text <strong>strong></strong>, or with

	<p> I've heard it gets more fun with <code>css</code>, but in the meantime, I'm going 
	to tell you what <cite>Albert Einstein</cite> says about creativity:</p>
	
		<blockquote>Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created 
		them.</blockquote>
