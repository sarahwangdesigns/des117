<!--Here are the instructions and starting code for your Futuristic Exercise.  The basic code is provided. If not already set, make sure you've set soft wrap for the text in textwrangler. 

1. Add a <header> tag under the body tag. This will hold your header image. Use an <img src="name of image"> tag to insert the text image I provided. Check in browser to make sure it views correctly.

2. Add a <h2> </h2> tag below the </header> and type in "The Futuristic Design Challenge"

3. Add a <p> </p> tag  below the </h2> Copy the text below and paste it all between this tag.

Note: you can add vertical space with a break tag <br />

(copy this text)
Create a two page website. The first page is a futuristic advertisement for some technology, event or activity.  You can use any image you wish and you are welcome to edit it in Photoshop.  The text is totally up to you as are the fonts that you use. We’ve only touched the surface with our web design skills so this exercise will pose both technical and artistic challenges. Just do the best you can to recreate the look and feel of a futuristic design.

		Create a text link from the first page to the second page.  
		The code for this is:
		<a href=“page2.html”>Design Summary</a>

		Answer two questions on your Design summary page:

		1.	What’s your definition of futuristic design?
		2.	What web skills or techniques do you wish you understood to help you execute your design more effectively.  For example, maybe you would like to know how to make columns in your advertisement.
		
		3. How would you create a link to return to the index.html page?  

		This assignment is to be completed by the start of our next class. It must open when we click on your name. You do not need a blog entry for this class only the futuristic design. Check out the Frequently Asked Questions before you ask for creative help...this is an opportunity for you to explore and learn.
