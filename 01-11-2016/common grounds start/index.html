	<h2>A note from our coffee traveler</h2>
	
	<p>As the fellow who travels the globe in search of the finest coffees to be found, I have a deep and personal connection to each of our coffees. More importantly, I have made a connection to the people and the lands that produce those wonderful coffees. For over 10 years it has been the coffee department's charge to develop and maintain relationships with the people at the beginning of our coffee supply chain. Those people are the farmers and the exporters in each country of origin. Unlike our company's size might suggest, we are not operating anonymously in purchasing our coffee. Instead, we have cultivated long-term relationships that are influencing and impacting entire families and communities around the globe.</p>

<!--Start this exercise by going to your xhtml ref file and placing the <DOCTYPE> at the 
top followed by the starting html, head, title, and body tags. Make sure they are in the 
correct order and closed properly.

Code for placing a background image. put inside body tag. <body background="old_paper.jpg">
 (make sure path is correct)

If you don't want a background image to repeat this style will fix.  
style="background-repeat: no-repeat;" (place after image)

Centering content, this will work on most elements. style="text-align: center;" 
try putting in the body tag to center content that follows

linking to html page from text. 
<a href="html/coffee.html">Coffee Beans</a>

linking to a page from an image (note the border="0" turns off link color surrounding a 
linked image)
<a href="html/beans.html"><img src="images/bean.gif"
border="0"></a>

look-up command. ../  you will soon discover how important it is to understand the 
relationship of the page you are coding to the content you are putting on the page and to 
the pages you will be linking to. the look-up command instructs code to look-up into the 
next higher directory...may take some getting used to.

So you want to change the color of the links from the ugly electric blue. you can add a 
html value link="#FF9900" vlink="#CC3333" to the body tag to change the color of the link 
and visited linj. this is not a style. we'll be using css styles to do this in future work.

Inline styles may be selectively applied to a word or line of text with the <span> tag
<span style="font-family: times;"> text </span>

Do you understand how inheritence is working as we apply inline styles?

add a contct link that goes to e-mail. <a href="mailto:yourname@ucdavis.edu">
