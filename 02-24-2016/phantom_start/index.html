<!--Here's the code for adding a style sheet with media query. 

    <link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (min-width: 481px)" href="css/desktop.css" /> If you wanted to ad a media query for a style sheet that was activated by a phone at 480px how would you add that code?
        
We are introducing viewport code which will reset the mobile browsers. Put this code in just above the closing </head> tag. It's particularly good for all versions of the iPhone.

<meta name="Viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

We can add a shadow to type in CSS3 with text-shadow: 4px 4px 4px #fff; try adding this in your css to the <h1> and see how it works! Then modify as desired.

Together weâ€™ll create index.html and video.html use same basic code as video.html

Challenge: Create new launch.html page. Use same basic code as video.html. Change link name to working Launch and add autoply audio track to the launch.html page. Use your downloaded audio file (make two versions oog and mp3) add controls or autoplay as desired.

Adding a Phantom facts page is optional.
