<p>Hi, my name is Sarah Wang and I am a Junior standing and first-year transfer from UCSD. 
I look forward to learning more about web design and interface design! :) One of my 
favorite design blogs is The DSGN Blog. 
<a href="http://thedsgnblog.com/"> Here is a link to it!</a></p>

I like food, so here is a picture I took when I went to eat tacos with my friends
a while back in San Jose over the summer.
