<!-- This simple demonstration will help you understand the box model and how to use it in creative ways. 

You're starting with two descriptions which we will style, surround with a second container and modify with specifically designed borders.
Notice the use of the <main> tag. This is a new html5 selector used to identify the main content of a page.

First add id's to define the "box" for each article and p tag within the article.

<article id=box1>  and inside is <p id=w12>
<article id=box2>  and inside is <p id=midengine>

Set golbal body charateristics

Now add the background image to the main element.

Style articles and contianed p tags to point to the specific components.
