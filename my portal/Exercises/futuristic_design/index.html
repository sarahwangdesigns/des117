		<p>SmileyToast is a transparent toaster that will toast your toast perfectly to 
		your liking.</p>
		<p>The transparency of SmileyToast also	allows you to better monitor how toast your
		toast gets, better ensuring a perfect toast in your definitions and to your 
		preference. All functions of the toaster are applicable with a touch of the transparent
		screen.</p>
		<p>Not only does SmileyToast have a built in clock, but it has six standard settings
		for how toasty you would like your toast. If those six standard settings don't satisfy 
		you, you can create your own custom settings too, from level of toastiness you want
		your toast to get, to the temperature you want your toast to toast at and for how long 
		the toast should toast for. In addition, SmileyToast also acts as a cooking timer. 
		SmileyToast will alert you when your toast or timer is done with a sound or song of 
		your choice, or no sound at all.</p>
		<p> SmileyToast also has an option of imprinting your toast with a happy face, a 
		optional feature added to promote mental awareness. Therefore, fore every SmileyToast
		purchased,SmileyToast will donate to the Trevor Project, a national organization dedicated
		to  providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to lesbian, gay, 
		bisexual, and transgender teens and young adults. 
		<p>SmileyToast indefinitely will bring you smiles in the morning by making you your
		perfect toast every time and remind you that having a healthy state of mind everyday
		is important!</p>
