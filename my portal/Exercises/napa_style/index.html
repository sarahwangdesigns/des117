	<p>Our extraordinary oven allows for year-round outdoor cooking. Your pizza will never be better, or your roasted meats, vegetables and breads! Its unique domed shape is designed to build fast, even, high-convection heat internally and dissipate slowly. And the double-walled concrete composite construction ensures that you and your guests won’t burn themselves touching the outside. It features a 24" diam. firebrick cooking floor; 6" oven landing (to keep food warm and to hold pots or pans); smoke-diverting vent and chimney; metal door; and a wood-storing metal stand. The dome is weather-protected with a beautiful, Old-World Tuscan “giallo” glaze. Handmade in California.</p>

<!--I have provided a separate doument with instructions and text..Please open and read through and follow the sequence of steps. We'll be using CSS3 rules that will enhnace your web page designs. One of my favorites is the rgba rule. This rule allows us to adjust the opacity of a background color without changing the opacity of contents. Here's an example of the rule:

background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2); where rgb are the color vaues and the last number is the degree of opacity. Try putting the absolute positioned text over a white background. what would the rgb value's be?

Another nice look with css3 is the rounded corners. you can apply these to an element with the following rule:
border-radius: 15px; 

This exercise more importnatly demonstrates responsive web design. How we might use media queries to detect different size devices so that we can deliver an optimum web experience.

The code for a media querie for a typical tablet in vertical orientation:
<link rel=stylesheet media="screen and (min-width:480px) and (max-width:780px)" href=medium.css>  does this make sense?
