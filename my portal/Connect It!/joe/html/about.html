<p id="aboutdes">Joe is a coffee machine, but he is not just any old coffee machine. Joe brews you your favorite cup of coffee  based on type of coffee you make for each day of the week and based on the times you wake up for every day of the week, respectively. After using Joe regularly for a month wether its via manual or via our app, Joe will record the times and days of the week along with what kind of coffee you usually make for those days and times of the week, respectively, so you'll never have to worry about forgetting to brew yourself a cup of Joe to wake you up and keep you energized for the day.
