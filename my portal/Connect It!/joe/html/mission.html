<p id=mtitle><em><b>Joe is on a mission for everyone.</b></em></p></p>

<p id="missiondes">Joe's ultimate mission is to brew your perfect coffee everyday during the times you tend to drink coffee. Not only is Joe quick and easy to use via voice command or via its mobile app "JoeCoffee," but Joe cares about the environment as well. Joe is made of recycled parts of broken coffee machines, is energy star labeled, and Joe's partnerships with supply and coffee bean companies are all USDA certified all natural and organic and made and grown with sustainable practices in mind to not only keep your mind awake, but at ease as well.</p>
