	<h3>CREATIVE BRIEF</h3>
	
<br />
<p>
Title : What are comets made of?
<br />
<br />
Project Summary: My goal for the website is to teach children ages 6-12 what a comet is basically made of aka what the basic anatomy of a comet is.
<br />
<br />
Audience Profile : My audience is children ages 6-12 years old, or anyone who decides to visit the Aerospace Museum and/or view my website and want to learn basic knowledge of what is the anatomy of a comet.
<br />
<br />
Perception and Tone : I am aiming for a kid-friendly website. Just something clean and simple and easy to read and navigate through, yet visually pleasing. 
<br />
<br />
Communication Strategy : My strategy is to use Sans-Serif fonts and to not use too many colors for the most part for the clean and easy readability. I plan to describe the comets in the simplest way as possible and stick to using terms and information a 6-12year old would be able to understand for the most part.
<br />
<br />
Target Message : I want my audience to be able to understand the information I am trying to convey on my website, which is what comets are made of.</p>

<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>

<p>I plan to stick with a general sans-serif font for both headline and body for easy readability and simplicity. Perhaps Lobster Two for headlines and Lato for bodies. I will have to link or embed these fonts with google fonts.</p>
